# note for my notebook,
# the dependent variable is the effect in the causal
# relationship while all of the independent variables
# are the cause that creates what the dependent variable is

Assumptions of linear regression
1: Linearity - Linear relationships between y and each x

2: Homoscedasticity - Equal Variance meaning that you dont want
to see a cone type shape whether increasing or decreasing

3: Multivariate Normality - Normality of error distribution

4: Independence - of observations, Includes "no autocorrelation"
This pretty much means that we dont want to see patterns in the data

5:Lack of MultiCollinearity - Predictors are not correlated with each other
X1 +X2 (thats good)
X1~X2 (not good??)

(not an actual check but good to keep in my mind
6: The Outlier Check - this is not an assumption but an extra check

outliers can change the way your dataset is presented so you should
check if you wanna keep them or if you wanna take them out
this will generally depend on your knowledge of the dataset and
the business
